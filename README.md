# onboardapi

## Overview

The [onboardapi](https://rheinmetall.github.io/onboardapi-documentation) defines a structured data model and middleware for bidirectional communication between distributed components.

It is designed for high-demand, modular systems such as:

- Sensor networks
- Onboard communication layers
- Robotics systems
- Embedded distributed architectures
- Service-oriented edge platforms

The data model is defined using a custom format `.rmodel` based on the ddkit framework (rmodel-api).

> Please note that the `.rmodel` data model is for documentation purposes only and does not reflect the actual interface used on the communication layer. Network communication is only possible through the provided libraries.

For detailed documentation, please refer to the [official documentation](https://rheinmetall.github.io/onboardapi-documentation).

Available for:

- C++
- Python
- C# / .NET
- Java

## Tools

The [onboardapi-inspector](https://github.com/Rheinmetall/onboardapi-inspector) is a graphical debugging interface designed for the onboardapi framework. It simplifies troubleshooting and provides live monitoring for your data.

## Digital Twin

Explore the capabilities of the onboardapi through a hands-on, interactive program available in the [digital twin repository](https://github.com/Rheinmetall/onboardapi-digital-twin).
